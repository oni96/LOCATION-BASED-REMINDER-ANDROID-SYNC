# Remember

Remember is an android application that allows to set reminders to a specific place in the map and you'll receive a notification as soon as you're in the area. It is what I call a "Location Based Reminder".

- Dynamic adding of reminders on long tap on the map.
- Receive notifications even without internet connections.
- Uses Google Places API to retrieve addresses.

### Note For Developers

- Please paste your own Google API key in the manifest.xml file. And make sure the Google Maps API and Google Places API are enabled.
